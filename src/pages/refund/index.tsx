        At snuggle bunny we promise to do our best to deliver an amazing
        product.

      <p>
        However, if the item is not suitable, we are happy to accept returns on
        any garment that is in the same condition that you received it, unworn
        or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You'll also need
        the receipt or proof of purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a 30-day return policy for returns and exchanges, which means
        you have 30 calendar days after receiving your item to request a return.
      </p>
      <h2>How can I start a return?</h2>
      <p>
        To save our precious trees, paper returns slips are not included in your
        package and we are taking returns online. To start a return, you can
        contact us at snugglebunnyclothing@gmail.com. If your return is
        accepted, we'll send you instructions on how and where to send your
        package.

        We suggest using your local post office for the delivery service and use

        Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be
        accepted. Please note that all returns must be delivered to our address
        within 30 days from receiving your order.

        are excluded unless the item is faulty or cancelled under our
